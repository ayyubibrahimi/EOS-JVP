    "# Analysis of GASB and LEQTF Holdings Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "## GASB Holdings Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### ISRAEL ST Investments:\n",
    "- **Mean Loss:** -1.43%\n",
    "  - Indicates an average unrealized loss, meaning the investments are worth less than their initial value.\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation:** 1.33%\n",
    "  - Losses are fairly consistent and not widely spread out.\n",
    "- **Range:** -2.79% to 0.00%\n",
    "  - No gains, with losses ranging up to -2.79%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Investments (filtered):\n",
    "- **Mean Loss:** 5.28%\n",
    "  - Represents an average gain in unrealized value, indicating an increase in investment value.\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation:** 20.83%\n",
    "  - High variability, showing a wide spread in unrealized gains/losses.\n",
    "  - The high standard deviation indicates that while some investments have performed exceptionally well, others have performed poorly, creating a broad range of outcomes.\n",
    "- **Range:** -21.29% to 90.57%\n",
    "  - Significant potential for both losses and gains.\n",
    "  - The wide range suggests that there are substantial differences in the performance of these investments, with some experiencing large gains and others large losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LEQTF Holdings Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### ISRAEL ST Investments:\n",
    "- **Mean Loss:** -1.43%\n",
    "  - Consistent with GASB, indicating an average unrealized loss.\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation:** 1.33%\n",
    "  - Low variability in losses.\n",
    "- **Range:** -2.79% to 0.00%\n",
    "  - No gains, similar loss range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Investments (filtered):\n",
    "- **Mean Loss:** 5.15%\n",
    "  - Indicates an average gain in investment value.\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation:** 20.77%\n",
    "  - High variability in gains and losses.\n",
    "  - Similar to the GASB dataset, the high standard deviation shows a broad range of investment outcomes, with some investments performing very well and others very poorly.\n",
    "- **Range:** -21.29% to 88.87%\n",
    "  - Wide range of potential losses and gains.\n",
    "  - This wide range further underscores the variability in performance, indicating that the investments can yield very different results, from significant losses to substantial gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ISRAEL ST Investments:**\n",
    "  - Show consistent, small losses (-1.43% mean loss) with low variability.\n",
    "  - Stable but negative performance, indicating lower risk but a consistent decline in value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Other Investments:**\n",
    "  - Exhibit higher average returns (5.28% and 5.15% mean gains) but with significant risk and variability.\n",
    "  - The high standard deviations (20.83% and 20.77%) and wide ranges (-21.29% to 90.57% for GASB and -21.29% to 88.87% for LEQTF) indicate that the returns on these investments can vary greatly.\n",
    "  - This variability means that while there is potential for high gains, there is also a risk of substantial losses. The wide range of outcomes suggests that these investments are more volatile and less predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"ISRAEL ST\" Investments:**\n",
    "  - Stable with consistent but small losses.\n",
    "  - Lower risk with predictable performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Other Investments:**\n",
    "  - Higher potential returns but come with greater risk and variability.\n",
    "  - Suitable for investors with higher risk tolerance seeking potential high returns."
